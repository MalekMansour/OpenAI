Goal: Creating a chatbot powered by AI.

Why?: Creating AI Assistants in different applications might always be something you want. Our OpenAI project is the key to making this possible. You can change the way your assistant talks as much as you want and it is very easy.

How?: We are using a OpenAI API key. Using model "gpt-3.5-turbo". system_msg is used to customise and moderate the AI Chatbot to the user's liking. gpt.html is the HTML/Javascript version of the gpt.py file. gradio.py is the same as gpt.py but powered by gradio.
