Goal: Turn a colored image into a colorless image.

Why?: Some people may want to print and colour certain pictures but find it hard to find a blank picture that matches their need. So using some machine learning technology, we are turning a coloured image into a colorless image.

How?: We are using a series of filters and image conversions (python, cv2, numpy)
