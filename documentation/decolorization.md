# Decolorization of Images with Python

## Goal
The goal of this Python script (`decolorization.py`) is to turn a colored image into a colorless (grayscale) image.

## Why
There are situations where individuals may want to print and color certain pictures but find it challenging to locate a blank picture that suits their needs. By employing machine learning technology, we can facilitate this process by transforming a colored image into a colorless one, providing a blank canvas for coloring.

## How
The script utilizes a series of filters and image conversions implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy. These filters and conversions manipulate the pixel values of the input colored image to achieve the desired effect of decolorization, resulting in a grayscale representation of the original image.
