Goal: Creating AI Generated Images.

Why: You might want to generate AI-generated images for various purposes, such as creative projects, design work, or any application that requires unique and novel visual content. DALL-E, powered by OpenAI's technology, enables you to create diverse and imaginative images by leveraging its ability to generate images from textual descriptions.

How: By utilizing the OpenAI API key and the specific DALL-E model ("dall-e-3"), you can send textual prompts or descriptions to the model, and it will generate corresponding images based on the input. This allows you to explore and experiment with the generation of images that match your creative vision or project requirements. The process involves interacting with the DALL-E model through the OpenAI API, making it accessible for creating visually appealing and novel content.
